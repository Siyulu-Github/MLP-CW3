    "prompt_text": "You are a robot that sorts and organizes colored blocks by adding and removing them to stacks.\nYou can move them between stacks to produce a desired end state.\n\nIn this task, you will see two photos of blocks. These photos show the beginning and end state of the blocks. Your task is to find a shortest movement plan to transit from the beginning state to the end state. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The stacks of blocks are presented in images. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine how to move them.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks. All stacks are on the table.\n- In a single move, you can only move the top block of any pile. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- You can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThis example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nYou can only move the top block of each stack: the purple block, the blue block, and the red block. The orange block is stuck underneath the red block and cannot be moved directly.\nEach move can place the block on another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n**Important Note**: The order of the stacks doesn't matter in this game. Two images are considered equivalent as long as the stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of the order in which the stacks appear. For example, an image with stack A on the left and stack B on the right is equivalent to an image with stack B on the left and stack A on the right.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, analyze the starting and ending configurations, including the number of stacks and the blocks in each stack (similar to the example above).\n2. Then, list the moves in a step-by-step manner using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET). Remember, \"SOURCE\" refers to the block being moved (always the top block of a stack), and \"TARGET\" refers to the destination (another stack or the table).\n\n## Example Output\n<Analysis> \nStarting state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nEnding state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: From bottom to top: Orange block, Blue block\n- Stack 3: Red block (alone)\n<Output>\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(blue,orange)\n\nNow please generate moving plan.

    "prompt_text": "You are a robot that sorts and organizes colored blocks by adding and removing them to stacks.\nYou can move them between stacks to produce a desired end state.\n\nIn this task, you will see two photos of blocks. These photos show the beginning and end state of the blocks. Your task is to find a shortest movement plan to transit from the beginning state to the end state. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The stacks of blocks are presented in images. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine how to move them.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks. All stacks are on the table.\n- In a single move, you can only move the top block of any pile. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- You can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThis example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nYou can only move the top block of each stack: the purple block, the blue block, and the red block. The orange block is stuck underneath the red block and cannot be moved directly.\nEach move can place the block on another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n**Important Note**: The order of the stacks doesn't matter in this game. Two images are considered equivalent as long as the stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of the order in which the stacks appear. For example, an image with stack A on the left and stack B on the right is equivalent to an image with stack B on the left and stack A on the right.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, analyze the starting and ending configurations, including the number of stacks and the blocks in each stack (similar to the example above).\n2. Then, list the moves in a step-by-step manner using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET). Remember, \"SOURCE\" refers to the block being moved (always the top block of a stack), and \"TARGET\" refers to the destination (another stack or the table).\n\n## Example Output\n<Analysis> \nStarting state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nEnding state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: From bottom to top: Orange block, Blue block\n- Stack 3: Red block (alone)\n<Output>\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(blue,orange)\n\nNow please generate moving plan.

    "prompt_text": "You are a robot that sorts and organizes colored blocks by adding and removing them to stacks.\nYou can move them between stacks to produce a desired end state.\n\nIn this task, you will see two photos of blocks. These photos show the beginning and end state of the blocks. Your task is to find a shortest movement plan to transit from the beginning state to the end state. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The stacks of blocks are presented in images. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine how to move them.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks. All stacks are on the table.\n- In a single move, you can only move the top block of any pile. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- You can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThis example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nYou can only move the top block of each stack: the purple block, the blue block, and the red block. The orange block is stuck underneath the red block and cannot be moved directly.\nEach move can place the block on another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n**Important Note**: The order of the stacks doesn't matter in this game. Two images are considered equivalent as long as the stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of the order in which the stacks appear. For example, an image with stack A on the left and stack B on the right is equivalent to an image with stack B on the left and stack A on the right.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, analyze the starting and ending configurations, including the number of stacks and the blocks in each stack (similar to the example above).\n2. Then, list the moves in a step-by-step manner using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET). Remember, \"SOURCE\" refers to the block being moved (always the top block of a stack), and \"TARGET\" refers to the destination (another stack or the table).\n\n## Example Output\n<Analysis> \nStarting state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nEnding state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: From bottom to top: Orange block, Blue block\n- Stack 3: Red block (alone)\n<Output>\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(blue,orange)\n\nNow please generate moving plan.

    "prompt_text": "You are a robot that sorts and organizes colored blocks by adding and removing them to stacks.\nYou can move them between stacks to produce a desired end state.\n\nIn this task, you will see two photos of blocks. These photos show the beginning and end state of the blocks. Your task is to find a shortest movement plan to transit from the beginning state to the end state. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The stacks of blocks are presented in images. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine how to move them.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks. All stacks are on the table.\n- In a single move, you can only move the top block of any pile. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- You can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThis example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nYou can only move the top block of each stack: the purple block, the blue block, and the red block. The orange block is stuck underneath the red block and cannot be moved directly.\nEach move can place the block on another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n**Important Note**: The order of the stacks doesn't matter in this game. Two images are considered equivalent as long as the stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of the order in which the stacks appear. For example, an image with stack A on the left and stack B on the right is equivalent to an image with stack B on the left and stack A on the right.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, analyze the starting and ending configurations, including the number of stacks and the blocks in each stack (similar to the example above).\n2. Then, list the moves in a step-by-step manner using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET).

    "prompt_text": "You are a robot that sorts and organizes colored blocks by adding and removing them to stacks.\nYou can move them between stacks to produce a desired end state.\n\nIn this task, you will see two photos of blocks. These photos show the beginning and end state of the blocks. Your task is to find a shortest movement plan to transit from the beginning state to the end state. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The stacks of blocks are presented in images. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine how to move them.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks. All stacks are on the table.\n- In a single move, you can only move the top block of any pile. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- You can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThis example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nYou can only move the top block of each stack: the purple block, the blue block, and the red block. The orange block is stuck underneath the red block and cannot be moved directly.\nEach move can place the block on another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n**Important Note**: The order of the stacks doesn't matter in this game. Two images are considered equivalent as long as the stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of the order in which the stacks appear. For example, an image with stack A on the left and stack B on the right is equivalent to an image with stack B on the left and stack A on the right.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, analyze the starting and ending configurations, including the number of stacks and the blocks in each stack (similar to the example above).\n2. Then, list the moves in a step-by-step manner using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET). Remember, \"SOURCE\" refers to the block being moved (always the top block of a stack), and \"TARGET\" refers to the destination (another stack or the table).\n\n## Example Output\n<Analysis> \nStarting state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nEnding state: there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: From bottom to top: Orange block, Blue block\n- Stack 3: Red block (alone)\n<Output>\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(blue,orange)\n\nNow please generate moving plan.

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The block configuration is presented in the image. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThe sequence of actions provided is:\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(green,table)\n\nIn this example, there are four blocks in three stacks. The stacks are:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nIt is valid to move the purple block, the blue block, and the red block, since they are at the top of a stack. It is invalid to move the orange block since it is not at the top of a stack (because it is covered by the red block).\nEach move can place the block on top of another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid as shown above.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"<Output> Yes\" or \"<Output> No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nHere is an example for the output:\n<Analysis> In the image, there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nThe first action \"move(red,table)\" is valid, because the red block is on top of a stack (stack 3 in this case), and the target is \"table\". After the first action, the state will become:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: Orange block (alone)\n- Stack 4: Red block (alone)\nThe second action \"move(green,table)\" is invalid, because there is no green block.\nTherefore, the provided action sequence is invalid.\n<Output> No\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the following input state:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n<ACTION-SEQ>",

Meanwhile, you will be provided an action sequence about moving blocks. Your task is to determine if the provided action plan can be successfully executed. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The block configuration is presented in the image. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThe sequence of actions provided is:\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(green,table)\n\nIn this example, there are four blocks in three stacks. The stacks are:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nIt is valid to move the purple block, the blue block, and the red block, since they are at the top of a stack. It is invalid to move the orange block since it is not at the top of a stack (because it is covered by the red block).\nEach move can place the block on top of another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid as shown above.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"<Output> Yes\" or \"<Output> No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nHere is an example for the output:\n<Analysis> In the image, there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nThe first action \"move(red,table)\" is valid, because the red block is on top of a stack (stack 3 in this case), and the target is \"table\". After the first action, the state will become:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: Orange block (alone)\n- Stack 4: Red block (alone)\nThe second action \"move(green,table)\" is invalid, because there is no green block.\nTherefore, the provided action sequence is invalid.\n<Output> No\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the following input state:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n<ACTION-SEQ>",

You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules:\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\nThe sequence of actions provided is:\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(green,table)\n\nIn this example, there are four blocks in three stacks. The stacks are:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nIt is valid to move the purple block, the blue block, and the red block, since they are at the top of a stack. It is invalid to move the orange block since it is not at the top of a stack (because it is covered by the red block).\nEach move can place the block on top of another stack or on the table (creating a new stack of one).  For instance, you could move the red block to either the blue stack or the table.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid as shown above.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"<Output> Yes\" or \"<Output> No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nHere is an example for the output:\n<Analysis> In the image, there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nThe first action \"move(red,table)\" is valid, because the red block is on top of a stack (stack 3 in this case), and the target is \"table\". After the first action, the state will become:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: Orange block (alone)\n- Stack 4: Red block (alone)\nThe second action \"move(green,table)\" is invalid, because there is no green block.\nTherefore, the provided action sequence is invalid.\n<Output> No\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the following input state:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n<ACTION-SEQ>",
