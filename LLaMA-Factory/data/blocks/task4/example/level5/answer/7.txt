<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with red block
- Stack with orange block, yellow block, green block, blue block, from bottom to top
The action "move(blue,table)" is valid. We execute this action.

Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with red block
- Stack with orange block, yellow block, from bottom to top
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with green block

<Output> No
