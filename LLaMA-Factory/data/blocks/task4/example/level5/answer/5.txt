<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with yellow block, green block, purple block, red block, from bottom to top
The action "move(yellow,table)" is invalid and cannot be executed, because the yellow block is below the green block and cannot be moved. The action sequence is therefore invalid, so we stop analyzing here.
<Output> No
