<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with yellow block, orange block, purple block, blue block, green block, from bottom to top
The action "move(green,table)" is valid. We execute this action.
Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with yellow block, orange block, purple block, blue block, from bottom to top
- Stack with green block
The action "move(blue,green)" is valid. We execute this action.
Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with yellow block, orange block, purple block, from bottom to top
- Stack with green block, blue block, from bottom to top

<Output> No
