<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with green block
- Stack with yellow block, red block, blue block, purple block, from bottom to top
The action "move(purple,green)" is valid. We execute this action.
Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with green block, purple block, from bottom to top
- Stack with yellow block, red block, blue block, from bottom to top
The action "move(purple,orange)" is invalid and cannot be executed, because there is no orange blocks. The action sequence is therefore invalid, so we stop analyzing here.
<Output> No
