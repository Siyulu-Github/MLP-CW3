- Stack with purple block, green block, from bottom to top
- Stack with red block, yellow block, blue block, from bottom to top
The action "move(blue,table)" is valid. We execute this action.

Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with purple block
- Stack with red block
- Stack with blue block, green block, from bottom to top
- Stack with yellow block
