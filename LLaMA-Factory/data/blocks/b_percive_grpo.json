Meanwhile, you will be provided an action sequence about moving blocks. Your task is to determine if the provided action plan can be successfully executed. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The block configuration is presented in the image. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1.
