The input contains 4 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 2 has 3 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an purple block, level 2 has an red block, level 3 has an yellow block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the blue block and the purple block?",since the blue block does not exist in the demonstrated configurations, the correct answer is "<Output> D".
<Output> D
