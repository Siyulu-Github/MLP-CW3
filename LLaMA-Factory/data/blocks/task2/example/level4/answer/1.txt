- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a red block.
- Stack 2 has 3 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an orange block, level 2 has an green block, level 3 has an purple block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the orange block and the purple block?",since the orange block is directly below the purple block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
