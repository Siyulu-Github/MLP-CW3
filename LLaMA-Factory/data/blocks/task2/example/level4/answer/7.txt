The input contains 4 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 2 has 3 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an yellow block, level 2 has an red block, level 3 has an green block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the yellow block and the red block?",since the yellow block is directly below the red block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
<Output> B
