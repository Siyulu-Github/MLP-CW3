The input contains 5 blocks in 4 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a blue block.
- Stack 2 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 3 has 1 level. Level 1 has a purple block.
- Stack 4 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an yellow block, level 2 has an red block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the yellow block and the red block?",since the yellow block is directly below the red block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
<Output> B
