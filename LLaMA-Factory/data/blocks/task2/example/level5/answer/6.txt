The input contains 5 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 2 has 4 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an green block, level 2 has an red block, level 3 has an purple block, level 4 has an blue block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the yellow block and the orange block?",since the yellow block does not exist in the demonstrated configurations, the correct answer is "<Output> D".
<Output> D
