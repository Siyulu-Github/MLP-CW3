The input contains 3 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a purple block.
- Stack 2 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an blue block, level 2 has an green block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the blue block and the green block?",since the blue block is directly below the green block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
<Output> B
