The input contains 3 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a yellow block.
- Stack 2 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an orange block, level 2 has an green block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the red block and the yellow block?",since the red block does not exist in the demonstrated configurations, the correct answer is "<Output> D".
<Output> D
