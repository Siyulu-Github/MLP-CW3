In this task, you will analyze an image containing several stacks of blocks. Later, you will be presented with four choices, each offering a textual representation of a block configuration. You will need to choose the configuration that exactly reflects the contents of the given image.

## Game Setup
- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).
- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.

This is an image input example:

<IMAGE-1>

This example features four blocks arranged in three stacks:
- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)
- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)
- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block

Here are examples of textual representations:

(A)
- Stack with red block, yellow block, from bottom to top
- Stack with orange block, purple block, green block, from bottom to top

(B)
- Stack with purple block
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with orange block, red block, from bottom to top

(C)
- Stack with orange block
- Stack with purple block
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with green block, yellow block, from bottom to top

(D)
- Stack with green block
- Stack with yellow block, blue block, from bottom to top
- Stack with red block, orange block, from bottom to top

We can analyze which text representation exactly reflects the configurations in the image accordingly. In this example:
- The input image has 3 stacks, while Candidate A only has 2 stacks. Therefore, Candidate A is not the correct answer.
- Similarly, Candidate C has 4 stacks, which also cannot be correct.
- For Candidate B, the blocks in each stack match what's shown in the image. This is the correct answer.
- For Candidate D, the blocks in each stack do not match the image. For example, stack 1 in the image has a purple block, and there is no any purple block in Candidate D. So this is incorrect.
- Therefore, the final answer is B.

## Procedure and Output
Your output should follow this format:
1. First, analyze the block configuration in the image and candidates as shown above;
2. Then, answer the question with the format <Output> <Choice>, where <Choice> is one of {A,B,C,D}. For example, "<Output> A".

Now please choose the correct textual representation based on the given image below:

<TEST-IMAGE>

Here are the textual candidates:
