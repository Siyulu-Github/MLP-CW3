A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\". A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for the given maze and action sequence:\n\n R",

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\".

The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal?

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan.

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\". A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for the given maze and action sequence:\n\n UUDLURLDU",
