    "prompt_text": "As a professional maze solver, your task is to analyze a grid-based map and devise an action plan that enables a player to reach the goal from the starting point without falling into any holes, using the fewest possible moves. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4.

    "prompt_text": "As a professional maze solver, your task is to analyze a grid-based map and devise an action plan that enables a player to reach the goal from the starting point without falling into any holes, using the fewest possible moves. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down.

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step.

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

    "prompt_text": "As a professional maze solver, your task is to analyze a grid-based map and devise an action plan that enables a player to reach the goal from the starting point without falling into any holes, using the fewest possible moves. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\nThe following figure shows how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nNow you will solve the given maze. To solve it, please generate text EXACTLY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, generate an action plan to navigate to the goal step by step. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action. If not, correct it and re-generate the action plan.\n3. Next, verify if the steps successfully navigate the player to the goal without falling into the hole. If not, restart from step 2 and re-generate this step.\n4. If succeed, output an aggregated plan using \"Action plan: <PLAN>\", where <PLAN> is a string concatenated action in each step. For example, \"Action plan: L,L,R,U,D\" meaning an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down. Double check the final action plan is consistent with the previous analysis.\nDo not output any extra content after the above aggregated output.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the following maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>",

Both Candidate C and Candidate D are 4-by-4 mazes. Now we only need to choose from them.\n- For the remaining candidates, we compare the positions of the players, goals, and the holes in the maze.\n- We first check the input image. What is the position of the player in the image? The player is in row 1, column 1. We then check the remaining candidates. For Candidate C, the textual representation indicates the player is also at row 1, column 1, matching the input image. For Candidate D, the player is located at row 3, column 1. Hence, Candidate D is not the correct answer.\n- We double check the remaining Candidate C, and it correctly shows the position of the player, holes, and the goal. It is therefore the correct answer.\n<Answer> C\n\nYour output should consist of two parts:\n1. First, analysis the input image and candidates similar to the reasoning process above.\n2. Following the reasoning process, output answer as \"<Answer> <Choice>\", where \"<Choice>\" is one of {A,B,C,D}.\nImportant: Note that there will be only one correct answer. If you find no answer or multiple answers, you must go back and recheck your reasoning process. You are not allowed to provide 0 or more than 1 answer.\n\nNow answer the question below.

This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal?

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\nThe following figure illustrates the appearances of the player, holes, lands, and the goal within the maze.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN. This is because moving down brings them to Row 2, Column 1, and this cell is safe (without holes).\n- Moving UP has no effects. This is because the player is already in the topmost row.\n- Similarly, moving LEFT has no effects because the player is already in the left-most column.\n- Moving RIGHT places the player at Row 1, Column 2. Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"<Output> Yes\" or \"<Output> No\".

The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE!

The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE!

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\nThe following figure illustrates the appearances of the player, holes, lands, and the goal within the maze.\n\n<IMAGE-1>\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\nWe provide an example to further illustrate the rules.\n\n<IMAGE-2>\n\nIn this provided example:\n- The player is at Row 1, Column 1;\n- The goal is at Row 4, Column 4;\n- There are two holes: one at Row 1, Column 2, and another at Row 4, Column 1.\n- The player can move DOWN.

Since there is a hole at this grid, this move results in a loss.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map.

At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal?

A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for this given maze:\n\n<TEST-IMAGE>\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n<ACTION-SEQ>",
