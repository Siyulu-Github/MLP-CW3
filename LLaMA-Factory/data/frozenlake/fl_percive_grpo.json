You will need to choose the representation that exactly reflects the contents of the given image.\n\nThis is how the player, the holes (non-safe grid), the lands (safe grids), and the goals look like in a map:\n- The player is represented as \"@\"\n- The hole is represented as \"#\"\n- The safe grid is represented as \"_\"\n- The goal is represented as \"*\"\n- If the player is at the goal (at this case the game is solved), that grid is represented as \"%\"\n\nYour output should consist of two parts:\n1. First, analysis the input image and candidates.\n2. Following the reasoning process, output answer as \"<Choice>\", where \"<Choice>\" is one of {A,B,C,D}.\nImportant: Note that there will be only one correct answer.
