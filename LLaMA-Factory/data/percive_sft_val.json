Meanwhile, you will be provided an action sequence about moving blocks. Your task is to determine if the provided action plan can be successfully executed. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The block configuration is presented in the image. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"Yes\" or \"No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nHere is an example for the output:\n<Analysis> In the image, there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nThe first action \"move(red,table)\" is valid, because the red block is on top of a stack (stack 3 in this case), and the target is \"table\". After the first action, the state will become:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: Orange block (alone)\n- Stack 4: Red block (alone)\nThe second action \"move(green,table)\" is invalid, because there is no green block.\nTherefore, the provided action sequence is invalid.\nNo\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the input state.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n(A)\n- Stack with orange block\n- Stack with green block, blue block, from bottom to top\n\n(B)\n- Stack with orange block\n- Stack with blue block, green block, from bottom to top\n\n(C)\n- Stack with purple block\n- Stack with green block\n- Stack with yellow block\n- Stack with orange block, blue block, from bottom to top\n\n(D)\n- Stack with orange block\n- Stack with blue block, yellow block, green block, from bottom to top",

    "solution": "<think>\n- First, we focus on the difference of the maze shape betweeen the candidates and the input image.\n- We begin by examining the input image. It is a 8-by-8 maze. We then review the candidates.\n- Candidate A is a 6-by-6 maze. Candidate B is a 8-by-8 maze. Candidate C is a 8-by-8 maze. Candidate D is a 7-by-7 maze. Therefore, Candidate A and D cannot be correct. Now we only need to choose from Candidate B and C.\n- For the remaining candidates, we compare the positions of the players, goals, and the holes in the maze.\n- We first check the input image. What is the position of the player in the image? The player is in row 6, column 2. We then check the remaining candidates. For Candidate B, the textual representation indicates the player is also at row 6, column 2, matching the input image. For Candidate C, the player is located at row 5, column 1. Hence, Candidate C is not the correct answer.</think>\n<answer>{\"Answer\": \"B\"}</answer>"
