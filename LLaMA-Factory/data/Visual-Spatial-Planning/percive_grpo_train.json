Meanwhile, you will be provided an action sequence about moving blocks. Your task is to determine if the provided action plan can be successfully executed. Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The block configuration is presented in the image. You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"Yes\" or \"No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the input state.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n1. move(red,table)\n2. move(orange,table)\n3. move(yellow,table)\n4. move(blue,table)\n5. move(orange,blue)\n6. move(red,orange)\n7. move(purple,yellow)",

    "problem": "You are a maze-solving agent playing a pixelated maze videogame.\nMazes are presented on grid maps, where each tile can be empty land, or contain a player, hole, or goal.\nEach of the above tile types are represented as square pixel art images.\n\nIn this task, you will analyze a grid-based map and determine if a provided action plan is safe. A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\". A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for the given maze and action sequence:\n\n LDDDUUD",
