Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning.\n\n## Game Setup\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- In the questions, the position of the blocks is represented as \"Stack s, Level l\". The stack number is counted from left to right, and the level number is counted from bottom to top.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format: \n1. First, analyze the block configuration;\n2. Then, answer the question with the format <Color>, where <Color> is one of (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green). For example, \"red\".\n\nNow please answer the following question based on the given image:\n\nWhat is the color of the block at stack 3, level 1?",

You must view and interpret the image in order to determine which blocks are in which stack and determine the consequence of moving.\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically in a stack, forming multiple stacks.\n- A valid action can only move the top block of any stacks. Attempting to move lower blocks is considered an invalid move.\n- For the destination, a valid move can either (a) move the top block to the top of another stack, or (b) place the top block on the table, creating a new stack with just one block.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should follow this format:\n1. First, briefly analyze the block configuration, and check each action step by step to see if the provided step is valid.\n2. Then, answer the question with the format \"Yes\" or \"No\" to indicate if the action sequence is valid.\n\nHere is an example for the output:\n<Analysis> In the image, there are three stacks:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: From bottom to top: Orange block, Red block\nThe first action \"move(red,table)\" is valid, because the red block is on top of a stack (stack 3 in this case), and the target is \"table\". After the first action, the state will become:\n- Stack 1: Purple block (alone)\n- Stack 2: Blue block (alone)\n- Stack 3: Orange block (alone)\n- Stack 4: Red block (alone)\nThe second action \"move(green,table)\" is invalid, because there is no green block.\nTherefore, the provided action sequence is invalid.\nNo\n\nNow please determine if the provided action sequence is valid given the input state.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n(A)\n- Stack with yellow block, purple block, orange block, red block, from bottom to top\n\n(B)\n- Stack with orange block\n- Stack with red block\n- Stack with blue block, yellow block, purple block, from bottom to top\n\n(C)\n- Stack with green block\n- Stack with red block, orange block, purple block, blue block, from bottom to top\n\n(D)\n- Stack with blue block\n- Stack with orange block\n- Stack with yellow block\n- Stack with red block, purple block, from bottom to top",

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\". A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for the given maze and action sequence:\n\n ",

The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan.

A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan.

    "problem": "You are a maze-solving agent playing a pixelated maze videogame.\nMazes are presented on grid maps, where each tile can be empty land, or contain a player, hole, or goal.\nEach of the above tile types are represented as square pixel art images.\n\nIn this task, you will analyze a grid-based map and determine if a provided action plan is safe. A safe action plan avoids stepping into holes in the map.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\n## Procedure and Output\nYour output should include the following parts:\n1. First, interpret map. List where the player is at now, where is the goal, and where are the holes.\n2. Then, reasoning by following the given action plan. At each step, you should check:\n    (a) Where the current move leads the player to (the row and column);\n    (b) What is in that grid. Is it a hole? Is it the goal? Is it an empty space?\n    (c) Determine if that is a safe action.\n3. Output if the action sequence is safe using \"Yes\" or \"No\". A safe action sequence should not include any unsafe actions.\n\nNow please determine if the action sequence is safe for the given maze and action sequence:\n\n URRRLRDDL",
