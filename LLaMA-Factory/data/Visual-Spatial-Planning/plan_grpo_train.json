The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE!

Since coding is not within your skill set, your approach relies on logical reasoning of the map.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\nPlease generate action plan for the given maze:",
