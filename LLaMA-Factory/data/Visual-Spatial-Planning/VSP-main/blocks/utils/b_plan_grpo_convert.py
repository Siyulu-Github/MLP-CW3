Your goal is to find the shortest movement plan to transition between these states.\n\n### Game Rules\n- Each block has a unique color (blue, yellow, purple, orange, red, green).\n- Blocks are stacked vertically, and you can only move the top block of a stack.\n- Moves can:\n - Place the top block onto the top of another stack, or\n - Place the top block on the table to create a new stack.\n- Invalid moves: Attempting to move non-top blocks.\n- Order of stacks does not matter. Configurations are equivalent if stacks contain the same blocks, regardless of their arrangement.\n\n### Output Format\nList moves step-by-step using the format move(SOURCE, TARGET), where:\n- SOURCE is the color of the block being moved (always the top block of a stack).\n- TARGET is either a destination stack (specified by the color of its top block) or table (to create a new stack).\n\n### Task\nGenerate the shortest plan to transform the beginning state into the end state shown in the images.\n\n"
