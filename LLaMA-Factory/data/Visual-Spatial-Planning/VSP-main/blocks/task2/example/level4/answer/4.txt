The input contains 4 blocks in 3 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a green block.
- Stack 2 has 1 level. Level 1 has a red block.
- Stack 3 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an blue block, level 2 has an orange block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the orange block and the blue block?",since the orange block is directly above the blue block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> A".
<Output> A
