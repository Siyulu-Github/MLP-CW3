- Stack 2 has 1 level. Level 1 has a purple block.
- Stack 3 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an red block, level 2 has an orange block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the red block and the purple block?",since the red block and the purple block are at different stacks, the correct answer is "<Output> C".
<Output> C
