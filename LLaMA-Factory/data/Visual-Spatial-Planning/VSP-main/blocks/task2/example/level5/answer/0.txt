The input contains 5 blocks in 3 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a blue block.
- Stack 2 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 3 has 3 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an yellow block, level 2 has an purple block, level 3 has an green block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the purple block and the yellow block?",since the purple block is directly above the yellow block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> A".
<Output> A
