The input contains 5 blocks in 4 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a purple block.
- Stack 2 has 1 level. Level 1 has a yellow block.
- Stack 3 has 1 level. Level 1 has a blue block.
- Stack 4 has 2 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an green block, level 2 has an red block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the green block and the red block?",since the green block is directly below the red block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
<Output> B
