The input contains 5 blocks in 2 stacks. From left to right:
- Stack 1 has 1 level. Level 1 has a orange block.
- Stack 2 has 4 level. From bottom to top: level 1 has an green block, level 2 has an blue block, level 3 has an purple block, level 4 has an yellow block,
As such, for the question "What is the spatial relation betweeen the blue block and the yellow block?",since the blue block is directly below the yellow block and they are in the same stack, the correct answer is "<Output> B".
<Output> B
