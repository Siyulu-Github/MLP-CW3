- Stack with purple block, red block, from bottom to top
- Stack with blue block, green block, orange block, from bottom to top
The action "move(orange,table)" is valid. We execute this action.

Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with blue block, purple block, orange block, from bottom to top
- Stack with green block, red block, from bottom to top
The action "move(orange,green)" is invalid and cannot be executed, because the green block is below the red block and is not a valid destination. The action sequence is therefore invalid, so we stop analyzing here.
