<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with orange block
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with purple block
- Stack with red block, green block, from bottom to top
The action "move(green,table)" is valid. We execute this action.

Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with orange block
- Stack with blue block
- Stack with purple block, red block, from bottom to top
- Stack with green block
The action "move(purple,table)" is invalid and cannot be executed, becuase the purple block is below the red block and cannot be moved. The action sequence is therefore invalid, so we stop analyzing here.
<Output> No
