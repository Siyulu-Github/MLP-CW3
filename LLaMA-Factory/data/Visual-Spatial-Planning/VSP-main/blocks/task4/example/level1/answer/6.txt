<Analysis> Now the current block configuration is:
- Stack with green block
- Stack with purple block
- Stack with yellow block
- Stack with blue block, red block, from bottom to top
The action "move(blue,purple)" is invalid and cannot be executed, because the blue block is below the red block and cannot be moved. The action sequence is therefore invalid, so we stop analyzing here.
<Output> No
